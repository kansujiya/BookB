The AI engineer successfully built a full-stack e-commerce application, BookBlaze, initially cloning . The development followed a structured approach: initial UI mocking, gathering user feedback, implementing backend logic (FastAPI, MongoDB), integrating frontend with backend, and then iterative feature enhancements (policy pages, product detail improvements, social proof popups, company logos). Key challenges included adapting mock data to real API calls, handling frontend data consistency (cart count updates), and debugging user-reported issues like . The engineer consistently adhered to environment rules, used Shadcn UI components, and provided comprehensive guides for setup and API usage. The final state is a functional e-commerce site with product display, add-to-cart, and policy pages, with Razorpay integration currently in progress.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in two related tasks:
1.  **Providing Documentation:** The user requested a Postman collection for all API endpoints and a detailed guide on where these endpoints are pointed in the frontend code. The engineer successfully created  and .
2.  **Initiating Razorpay Integration:** The user explicitly requested to integrate Razorpay payment gateway, with a specific success message after payment. The engineer responded by creating  to outline the integration steps.
3.  **Verifying Current State:** The user then asked is this site is completed? like i want to see books product and then that book can add into cart and do checkout please confirm. The engineer confirmed that products are visible, can be added to the cart, and the cart page functions correctly. The system confirmed all these functionalities were working 100%. The explicit task of Razorpay integration is still pending implementation.
